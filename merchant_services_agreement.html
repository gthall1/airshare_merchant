							<h4 class="whitetext">Section 1 — Airshare Merchant Services</h4>
							<h5 class="whitetext">1.01 “Airshare Merchant Service(s)” means the services provided by Airshare defined as:</h5>
							<p class="whitetext">“Airshare Merchant Services” means the digital reward &amp; e-gift card services offered by Airshare which provide Merchants with the ability to send Airshare gifts as rewards or promotions to a Merchant’s own customers, and to redeem Airshare gifts from Airshare recipients or “Giftees” given to them by the Merchant, or another person, or “Gifter”. Airshare gifts generated by the Merchant, and redemptions of all Airshare gifts for that Merchant will be tracked and reported to the Merchant in each Merchant’s dashboard.</p>

							<h5 class="whitetext">1.2 “Approved Airshare Merchants” are:</h5>

							<ul>
								<li class="whitetext">Merchants who have completed the Airshare Merchant Enrollment and who have received acknowledgement that they are an Approved Airshare Merchant.</li>
								<li class="whitetext">Airshare reserves the right to preclude any Merchant from utilizing Airshare Merchant Services and the Airshare Marketplace. All Merchants must comply with the Airshare Marketplace Policy found at <a href="http://airshare.com/legal/marketplace_use/">http://airshare.com/legal/marketplace_use/</a></li>
							</ul>

							<h4 class="whitetext">Section 2 — Airshare Redemptions</h4>

							<p class="whitetext">2.01 Authorized Redeemers It is the Merchant’s responsibility to authorize who can redeem Airshare gifts on behalf of the Merchant. To do so you will need to provide Authorized employees with your unique Airshare redemption link or Merchant ID.</p>

							<ul>
								<li class="whitetext">Ensuring security and appropriate use of the Airshare Merchant redemption link or ID is the responsibility of the Merchant</li>
								<li class="whitetext">Ensuring Merchant account password security and Merchant account information integrity is the responsibility of the Merchant.</li>
							</ul>

							<p class="whitetext">Upon each Airshare redemption the Merchant’s employee will be required to:</p>

							<ul>
								<li class="whitetext">Enter the amount of the Airshare to be redeemed.</li>
								<li class="whitetext">Type their name</li>

								<li class="whitetext">Acknowledge they are an Approved Redeemer for the Merchant</li>
							</ul>

							<h5 class="whitetext">2.02 Authorized Redemptions</h5>

							<p class="whitetext">The Merchant and designated employees are only authorized to redeem Airshare gifts for that Merchant. That is redemptions for which the Giftee has provided the Merchant the Airshare redemption value generated from the Airshare in the gift recipient’s Airshare application. Merchant and Merchant employees will not attempt a fraudulent redemption of an Airshare for that, or another Merchant.</p>

							<h5 class="whitetext">2.03 No Redemption Refunds</h5>

							<p class="whitetext">Once the Airshare is redeemed by the Merchant, Airshare will not refund that amount to the Merchant or to the Giftee as Airshare will have already provided payment to the Merchant. Any disputes that arise between the Giftee and the Merchant after the redemption are the responsibility of the Merchant to solve with the Giftee in accordance with the Merchant’s refund policy.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">Airshare will, however, refund the Airshare redemption fee for any refunds of goods or services purchased with the Airshare gift in accordance with the Airshare Refund Policy.</p>

							<h5 class="whitetext">10.10 Governing Law and Agreement to Arbitrate for Merchants Domiciled in the United States</h5>

							<p class="whitetext">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL IMPACT HOW CLAIMS YOU AND AIRSHARE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.</p>

							<ul>
								<li class="whitetext">A. Governing Law - You and Airshare agree that the laws of the State of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between the parties, except as otherwise stated in this Agreement.</li>
								<li class="whitetext">B. Agreement to Arbitrate - You and Airshare agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Airshare shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.</li>
							</ul>

							<p class="whitetext">THE PARTIES ALSO AGREE THAT YOU AND AIRSHARE MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND AIRSHARE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER AIRSHARE MERCHANTS.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, or the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide. If a court decides that any part of this Section 10.10 is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Section 10.10 shall still apply.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">The arbitration shall be held in Santa Barbara County. Airshare may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Airshare subject to the discretion of the arbitrator(s) to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">The arbitrator(s) will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of California, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator(s) shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Merchants, but is/are bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Merchant to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitration award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
