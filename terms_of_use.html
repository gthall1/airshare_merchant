							<p class="whitetext">The Airshare Terms of Use is updated as of August 1, 2017.</p>

							<h4 class="whitetext">Welcome to Airshare</h4>
							<p class="whitetext">Welcome to Airshare and a new experience in gifting! Airshare strives to help people be better gifters, bring people closer to each other, and to help strengthen local merchants and communities. This happens when you gift and redeem Airshare gifts with the local Merchants you love! The primary goal of the Agreement is to support an exceptional Airshare experience and a safe environment for all.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">These Terms of Use, and the agreements, policies, and documents incorporated herein (this “Agreement”), is entered into by and between Airshare Technologies, LLC (“Company”, “we,” “us,” and “our” mean Airshare, our successors, affiliates or assignees), and the individual who enters into this Agreement (“you” or “User”). This Agreement sets out the terms of use under which you may utilize the Airshare application.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">This Agreement becomes a legally binding contract and is effective as of the earliest date you do any of the following (the “Effective Date”):</p>

							<h3 class="whitetext">These Terms of Use affect your legal rights and obligations. If you do not agree to be bound by all Terms of Use, do not access or use the Service.</h3>
							<p class="whitetext">This Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time without notice, will be available on the Airshare website at www.airshare.com, and via the mobile application in all its forms. In addition to the terms of this Agreement, you agree to be bound by the terms of all other Airshare policies including, but not limited to the Airshare Privacy Policy, and the Airshare Anti-Discrimination Policy.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND AIRSHARE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.</p>

							<h3 class="whitetext">About Airshare</h3>
							<p class="whitetext">Airshare enables electronic gifting for its Users to give and receive an Airshare gift via our mobile or web application. An Airshare gift is usable only at participating Merchants, for personal, family or household use, and cannot be resold. Airshare is not a money transmitter, or a money service business (“MSB”) or a provider or seller of a prepaid program.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">Each Airshare gift:</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="whitetext">Does not expire</li>
									<li class="whitetext">Is non-reloadable</li>
									<li class="whitetext">Clearly discloses the fee before purchase, if a fee is required</li>
								</ul>


							<h3 class="whitetext">Principal Terms of Use</h3>

							<p class="whitetext">1. To be eligible to use the Airshare Service, you must be a resident of the United States and be at least 13 years old and create an account with a cellular/wireless telephone number that you own. You may also initiate account registration by connecting with your Facebook® account, however, we will still need additional information to create your account. To register, create and use an account, Company may require that you submit certain Personal Information, including but not limited to your name, email address, text-enabled cellular/wireless telephone number, street address or zip code, date of birth, and social security number to Company. During the registration process, or when you access the Airshare Service from a phone, your phone's device ID is also stored. You agree that the Personal Information you provide to Company upon registration and at all other times will be true, accurate, current and complete, and you agree to maintain and update this Personal Information with us as necessary.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">2. <strong>Consent to use Electronic Communications.</strong> Airshare is provided solely online/web/mobile app based. All documents, communications, notices, contracts, agreements, and amendments made using the Service shall be governed by the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (Cal. Civil Code Section 1633.1 et. seq.) By using the Service, including our site and services, you agree to receive electronically all documents, communications, notices, contracts, agreements, and amendments arising from or relating in any way to your or our rights, obligations or services electronically, either through our site or via electronic mail to your last confirmed email address. The decision to do business with us electronically is yours. By agreeing to electronic communications, You confirm having access to necessary hardware and software equipment to receive, open, print, and download copies of communications. You should print a copy of this Agreement for your own records.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">3. You hereby authorize Company, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your identity and/or authenticate your identity and account information. This may include asking you for further information and/or documentation about your account usage or identity, or requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address, wireless/cellular telephone number or financial instruments, and verifying your information against third party databases or through other sources. This process is for internal verification purposes. You authorize your wireless operator (AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile, US Cellular, Verizon, or any other branded wireless operator) to use your mobile number, name, address, email, network status, customer type, customer role, billing type, mobile device identifiers (IMSI and IMEI) and other subscriber status details, if available, solely to allow verification of your identity and to compare information you have provided to GIACT Systems, LLC with your wireless operator account profile information for the duration of the business relationship.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">4. To purchase an Airshare gift, you may be asked to provide your credit card information, and billing address. An authorization will be placed on your card for the total price of the Airshare gift to ensure that you have sufficient funds available to cover the transaction. Pending a review of the transaction, your card will be charged the authorized amount. You authorize us to resubmit any charge that fails, is charged back or otherwise reversed. Airshare never sees, and does not store this information and works with a PCI compliant payment gateway to ensure the integrity of your credit card information. If your credit or debit card account number changes or your card expiration date changes, we may acquire that information from our financial services partner and update your account accordingly.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">5. We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the value of the Airshare gift you can send or receive through the Airshare Service. Each user is limited to gift a maximum of $250 per week. Airshare will also monitor the value of Airshare gifts received by users. If we have authenticated your identity, we may increase your limits. These limits may change from time to time in Company’s sole discretion and will not exceed $1,000. You may not gift an Airshare gift to yourself.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">6. When you send an Airshare gift, delivery is not guaranteed. After a reasonable time please confirm with the recipient that they have received the Airshare gift. Additionally, the recipient is not required to accept the Airshare gift. You agree that you will not hold Company liable for any damages resulting from a recipient's decision not to accept an Airshare gift made through the Airshare Service.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">7. If an Airshare gift recipient is not an Airshare user and does not register, set up an email address, mobile number or satisfy other necessary registration requirements to accept the Airshare gift within 30 days, the transaction will be canceled, and your purchase amount will be refunded to the original funding source.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">8. Airshare gift investigation is a process by which Company reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions subject to our own discretion. If an Airshare gift is subject to investigation, Company will place a hold on the Airshare gift and may provide notice to the recipient. Company will conduct a review and either clear or cancel the Airshare gift. If the Airshare gift is cleared, Company will provide notice to the recipient. Otherwise, Company will cancel the Airshare gift and the funds will be returned to the original funding source. Company will provide notice to you by email.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">9. When you receive an Airshare gift, you are liable to Company for the full amount of the Airshare gift plus any fees if the funding source of the Airshare gift giver for that Airshare gift is later invalidated for any reason. This means that, in addition to any other liability, you will be responsible for the amount of the Airshare gift, plus applicable fees if there is a reversal of the payment. If a sender of an Airshare gift later disputes the Airshare gift or files a claim for a chargeback, the debit or credit card issuer or the originating bank, not Company, will determine whether the dispute is valid and to whom payment is due. You agree to allow Company to recover any amounts due to Company by debiting your credit or debit card. If you have not yet associated a debit or credit card to your account, you agree to reimburse Company through other means. If Company is unable to recover the funds from one of these sources, Company may attempt to contact you, Company may recover the funds from your alternate funding sources, or may take other legal actions to collect the amount due, to the extent allowed by applicable law. Company, in its sole discretion, may place a hold on an Airshare gift you receive when Company believes there may be a high level of risk associated with the Airshare gift.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">10. If you have received an Airshare gift, Company will hold your funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use your funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes, and will not voluntarily make your funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. While your funds are in our custody, Company will combine your funds with the funds of other Users and place those pooled accounts in one or more bank accounts in Company's name. Upon the redemption of the Airshare gift with the selected Merchant(s) those funds, less any Airshare fees, are transferred to the Merchant(s).</p>

							<p class="whitetext">11. Company is not a bank or other chartered depository institution. Funds held by Company or its service providers (including any bank service providers) in connection with the processing of Airshare gifts are not deposit obligations and are not insured for the benefit of the user by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. Funds held in balance are an ancillary function of enabling a pre-paid card marketed as a gift card and not for other benefit.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">12. You agree that you will not receive interest or other earnings on the funds that Company handles and places in pooled accounts. In consideration for your use of the service, you irrevocably transfer and assign to Company any ownership right that you may have in any interest that may accrue on funds held in pooled accounts. This assignment applies only to interest earned on your funds, and nothing in this Agreement grants Company any ownership right to the principal of the funds associated with received Airshare gifts.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">13. In the event of an error, you give Company permission, subject to Company's compliance with applicable law, to make appropriate corrections by debiting or crediting your primary or alternate funding sources as applicable. If your Sent Airshare history shows Airshare gifts you did not send, reach us via the Contact Us section of our web site, or send us an email at <a href="mailto:support@airshare.com.">support@airshare.com</a></p>

							<p class="whitetext">When you notify us, provide us with all the following information:</p>

							<ul>
								<li class="whitetext">Your name, and the email address and phone number registered to your account</li>
								<li class="whitetext">A description of any suspected Unauthorized Transaction or Other Error and an explanation of why you believe it is incorrect or why you need more information to identify the transaction, and</li>
								<li class="whitetext">The dollar amount of any suspected Unauthorized Transaction or Other Error.</li>
							</ul>

							<p class="whitetext">During our investigation, we may request additional information from you.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">To be eligible for protection for Unauthorized Transactions sent from your account, you must notify us within 30 days after any Unauthorized Transaction or Other Error first appears in your account statement. If you do not tell us within 30 days after the account statement was made available to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 30 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we will extend the time periods.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">Once you notify us of any suspected Unauthorized Transaction or Other Error, or we otherwise learn of one, we will do the following:</p>

							<p class="whitetext">We will conduct an investigation to determine whether there has been an Unauthorized Transaction or Other Error that is eligible for protection.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">We will complete our investigation within 10 Business Days of the date we received your notification of the suspected Unauthorized Transaction or Other Error. If your account is new (the first transaction from your account was less than 30 Business Days from the date you notify us), we may take up to 20 Business Days to complete this investigation. If we need more time, we may take up to 45 days to complete our investigation (or up to 90 days for new accounts).</p>

							<p class="whitetext">We will inform you of our decision within 3 Business Days after completing our investigation. If we determine that there was an error, we will promptly credit the full amount of the error into your account within 1 Business Day of our determination.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">If we decide that there was not an Unauthorized Transaction or Other Error, we will include an explanation of our decision in our email or other communications to you. You may request copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">14. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, you may use your received Airshare gift(s) to pay for goods or services offered by Merchants that have been authorized by Company to accept Airshare gift redemptions as a payment option. While you are responsible for the amount of any Authorized Airshare Merchant Payment, Company will not charge you any fees for using your Airshare gift to complete an authorized payment, regardless of how the payment was funded. If the value of your Airshare gift is not sufficient to cover the entire required payment amount to the Airshare Merchant you will use another source of funding (cash, credit card, etc.) to settle the balance with the Merchant.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">15. If the value of your Airshare gift is greater than the bill provided by the Airshare Merchant, you will change the Airshare redemption amount to equal the value of the bill (to include any tips or gratuities if you like). It is not the responsibility of the Airshare Merchant to provide cash back to you to settle the difference between the total value of the Airshare gift, and the amount owed to the Airshare Merchant.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">16. Once an Airshare redemption has occurred and Approved, Airshare has no responsibility for returns or refunds of goods or services purchased from the Airshare Merchant. The Airshare Merchant may provide a return or refund to you according to their return policy. As Airshare will pay or have paid the Airshare Merchant in full for the value of the Approved Airshare any return or refund conversations and outcomes are between you and the Airshare Merchant.</p>

							<h3 class="whitetext">Arbitration</h3>

							<p class="whitetext">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL IMPACT HOW CLAIMS YOU AND AIRSHARE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.</p>

							<ul>
								<li class="whitetext">A. Governing Law - You and Airshare agree that the laws of the State of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between the parties, except as otherwise stated in this Agreement.</li>
								<li class="whitetext">B. Agreement to Arbitrate - You and Airshare agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Airshare shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.</li>
							</ul>

							<p class="whitetext">THE PARTIES ALSO AGREE THAT YOU AND AIRSHARE MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND AIRSHARE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER AIRSHARE MERCHANTS.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, or the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide. If a court decides that any part of this Section is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Section and all other provisions shall still apply.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">The arbitration shall be held in Santa Barbara County. Airshare may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Airshare subject to the discretion of the arbitrator(s) to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.</p>

							<p class="whitetext">The arbitrator(s) will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of California, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator(s) shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Airshare customers, but is/are bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same customer to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitration award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>

							<h3 class="whitetext">Time Limitation on Claims</h3>

							<p class="whitetext">You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Airshare must be filed within six months after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>

							<h3 class="whitetext">Entire Agreement</h3>

							<p class="whitetext">If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Airshare and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Airshare. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Airshare. Any purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Airshare will be null and void. Airshare may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
